# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository contains the Requirement Analysis Project for a Booking Management System, developed as part of a school assignment. The goal is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by clearly documenting, analyzing, and organizing system requirements. It serves as a structured yet accessible reference point for understanding the foundational phase of software development, with a focus on clarity, precision, and practical application.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, analyzing, and documenting what a software system needs to do and the conditions under which it must operate. It acts as the foundation for the entire development cycle by translating stakeholder needs into clear, actionable requirements. This phase ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s goals, helps prevent costly errors later in development, and guides the design, testing, and implementation processes. Ultimately, good requirement analysis leads to better planning, smoother execution, and a product that truly meets user expectations.
