# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository contains the Requirement Analysis Project for a Booking Management System, developed as part of a school assignment. The goal is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by clearly documenting, analyzing, and organizing system requirements. It serves as a structured yet accessible reference point for understanding the foundational phase of software development, with a focus on clarity, precision, and practical application.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, analyzing, and documenting what a software system needs to do and the conditions under which it must operate. It acts as the foundation for the entire development cycle by translating stakeholder needs into clear, actionable requirements. This phase ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the system’s goals, helps prevent costly errors later in development, and guides the design, testing, and implementation processes. Ultimately, good requirement analysis leads to better planning, smoother execution, and a product that truly meets user expectations.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
* **Prevents Miscommunication and Misalignment:** 
Requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders—clients, developers, designers, and testers—have a shared understanding of what the software should do. By clearly documenting expectations early, it reduces the risk of miscommunication, conflicting goals, or incorrect assumptions throughout the project.

* **Reduces Costly Rework:**
Identifying and resolving requirement issues early in the SDLC is far less expensive than fixing them during or after development. A thorough analysis helps catch missing, ambiguous, or conflicting requirements upfront, preventing wasted time, effort, and resources later in the project.

* **Provides A Solid Foundation for Design and Testing:**
Accurate and detailed requirements serve as a blueprint for designing the system architecture and writing test cases. They help ensure that the final product aligns with user needs and that every feature is tested against clear, predefined expectations.
